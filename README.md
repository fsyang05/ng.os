# ng.os

An AI-native operating system for nonprofits, live with organizations in Baltimore.

Email: felixyang2028@u.northwestern.edu.

## Structure

Made using Turborepo.
Webapp built with React and TypeScript, server built with Python.
Additional frameworks include fastapi, uv, pydantic.

Supports Vapi and/or LiveKit's webhook messages.

## Why?

Software should be used as a means to solve people's problems and make the world a better place.
I'm hopefully contributing by solving some of the biggest problems that homeless resource providers face.
